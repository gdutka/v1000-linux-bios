   2. Problem: UEFI OS install via UEFI from windows 2008 WDS failed
               on BCM57762.(CQ#60680)

      Change : Updated Driver to initialize NVRAM according to the
               correct ASIC REV for BCM57762, BCM57766, BCM57786,
               and BCM57782.

   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: On multiple port device, the MBA settings on one or more 
               ports may not be saved via HII browser.

      Cause:  On certain OEM systems, ExtractConfig() is called very early
              in the HII browser process.  This can result in stale MBA
              configuration being saved to NVRAM.

      Change:  Refresh MBA port configuration from NVRAM before updating 
               any MBA port configuration.

   2. Problem: Setting iSCSI Initiator name with '-' character fails via
               OEM configuration tool. (CQ#58951)

   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: drvdiag fails at Loopback test on BCM5719 in PCI-E
               Gen II mode.

      Cause:   During loopback test, DMA data exceed FIFO size and
               caused BCM5719 to cease operation.

      Change:  Reduced number of Receive Buffer Descriptors.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Hide device banner during initial load for certain OEM.(CQ#58681)

-------------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: drvdiag fails at register tests on BCM5718. (CQ#58108)

      Cause:   During drvdiag register tests, certain status registers can
               be updated by other components while the test is being run.
               This contention can cause a failure report.

      Change:  Remove status registers from the test matrix.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1. Updated device description strings in HII menus.

Version 15.0.10 August 17, 2011
-------------------------------
  Fixes:
  ======
  1. Problem:    When certain OEM system updated firmware images, the update 
                 applied to all ports of the same chip (CQ#57383).

     Change:     Driver installs Firmware Management Protocol only for first
                 port of the chip. This will only allow firmware image update
                 on first port.

     Relevance:  The design of installing Firmware Management Protocol for
                 all ports of the chip had been in place since Firmware 
                 Management Protocol was supported.

  2. Problem:    Missing x-UEFI tag. (CQ#57710)

     Change:     Added missing x-UEFI tag for Blink LEDs attribute.

     Change:     Updated modifier to use ReadOnlyIf per OEM specification.

     Relevance:  x-UEFI specification.


Version 15.0.9 August 5, 2011
-----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: HII Firmware Image Menu did not report MBA combined image
               properly. NCSI version was not correct. UMP and ASF firmware
               should not be displayed when NC-SI firmware was present
               (CQ#57643).

      Cause:   The NCSI version was computed wrongly. When determining
               entries in MBA combined image, data read from NVRAM were
               not in proper endian format that caused UEFI driver not to be
               detected. UMP, and ASF versions were always displayed even 
               though they did not exist in NVRAM.

      Change:  The NCSI version computation is fixed. MBA combined image
               information read from NVRAM is in proper endian format. Displays
               only the management firmware installed in NVRAM.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Implement software workaround for EEE PHY interoperability
      issues for all EEE capable devices except for BCM5720.

              BCM57785, BCM57791, and BCM57795 controllers only.
              
   2. After upgrading MBA, PXE enable bit is left untouched in NVRAM
      setting instead of always turning it on after upgrade.

Version 15.0.8 August 3, 2011
-----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: drvdiag fails on BCM5720. (CQ#57471)

      Cause:   During drvdiag register tests, certain status registers can
               be updated by other components while the test is being run.
               This contention can cause a failure report.

      Change:  Remove status registers from the test matrix.

Version 15.0.7 July 28, 2011
----------------------------
   Fixes:
   1. Problem: Boot Retry Count parameter in MBA Configuration menu is not
               configurable. (CQ#57371)

      Cause:   This parameter is not applicable.

      Change:  Remove Boot Retry Count from MBA Configuration menu.

Version 15.0.6 July 26, 2011
----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: Vlan ID parameter value in HII MBA Configuration menu is 
               inconsistent with value displayed by CCM. (CQ#57185)

      Cause:   When extracting Vlan ID data, the driver incorrectly swapped
               Vlan ID values.

      Change:  Updated driver to swap Vlan ID values properly during
               extraction.

  2.  Problem: Vlan ID parameter help message shows incorrect range value.

      Change:  Updated help message to display correct range values.
      
  3.  Problem: Drvdiag command did not work with UEFI revision 2.3. (CQ#57268)

      Cause:   UEFI revision 2.3 requires EFI_DRIVER_DIAGNOSTICS2_PROTOCOL
               support for diagnostics.

      Change:  Added support for EFI_DRIVER_DIAGNOSTICS2_PROTOCOL.
      
  4.  Problem: Upon exiting BOFM, driver always requested for system reboot
               even if there was no BOFM address change. (CQ#57291)

      Change:  Check if BOFM address is different from current virtual
               address before returning system reboot status.
      
      

Version 15.0.5 July 19, 2011
----------------------------
   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Updated Subnet Mask Prefix allowable field length to correct width.

   2. Removed colons from display strings in Firmware Image menu.
      (CQ#55173).

      software components such as NCSI.

Version 15.0.4 July 8, 2011
---------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: Upgrading iSCSI Boot component via Firmware Management
               Protocol returns insufficient space error on BCM5719.

      Cause:   When the driver re-arranges NVRAM images to remove memory 
               gaps, it incorrectly byte-swapped the extended directory
               contents which caused an incorrect size value.

      Change:  Updated driver to ensure contents of extended directory are
               in the correct order.

   2. Problem: NCSI firmware version is reported incorrectly in Firmware
               Management Protocol.

      Change:  Updated driver to correctly parse NCSI firmware version.

   3. Problem: BCM5718 with Self Bootcode, fails to ping other clients
               (CQ#56221).

      Cause:   Driver reads MAC address at incorrect offset in NVRAM for
               Self Boot mode.

      Change:  Updated driver to use correct offset for Self Boot devices.

Version 15.0.3 June 7, 2011
---------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: On certain OEM system, updating HII browser configuration 
               for selected device caused NVRAM data corruption. (CQ#56067)
      Cause :  Wrong manufacturing block data was used to update the
               selected device's NVRAM data.
      Change : The manufacturing block data is not stored in a global
               structure, but inside the device's data structure.

   2. Problem: BCM5720 fails to update iSCSI Boot with Firmware Management
               Protocol. (CQ#56015)
      Cause :  Driver incorrectly detected the number of ports supported by
               the device, and consequently calculated the necessary space
               incorrectly.
      Change : Updated driver to detect correct number of ports for device.

Version 15.0.2 May 19, 2011
---------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: Firmware Management Protocol GetImageInfo() returns 
               duplicate GUIDs for different firmware images. (CQ#55693)

      Cause : Method used to locate GUIDs was incorrect.

      Change : Updated search method to locate proper GUIDs.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Added "NONE" option to Boot Protocol in HII MBA Configuration menu.
      (CQ#55699)

   2. Removed unnecessary x-UEFI strings.

               BCM5720. (CQ#54953).

      Change : Updated driver to support NCSI firmware files.

   2. Problem: BCM5720 will not update boot code via Updatetest. (CQ#55097)

      Cause : Driver expects GetImageInfo() function to be called prior
              to initiating any other Updatetest operation.

      Change: Updated driver to remove dependency that GetImageInfo()
              be the first operation executed.     

   3. Problem: Some HII attributes have a colon in the display string. (CQ#55173)
      Change : Removed colons from attribute display strings.

   4. Problem: Incorrect modifier for attribute BootToTarget. (CQ#54947)

      Change : Updated modifier to SuppressIf for BootToTarget attribute.

-----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   Problem: Upgrading bootcode using Firmware Management Protocol fails
            for BCM5719 devices. (CQ#53785)

   Cause :  Driver incorrectly parsed the proposed bootcode image file,
            which caused it to assume it is an unsupported file image.

   Change : Updated driver to correctly identify bootcode image file
            structure.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Added support for BCM5720 controller. (CQ#53771)

     Change : Updated driver to include proper register values for 
              DRVDIAG test.

  2. Problem: When running multiple family devices, using different driver
              versions, the HII browser may crash.

     Cause :  Differing driver versions contains varying support
              functionality to retrieve other devices hardware info. The
              driver did not check the supported capabilities of a 
              different driver before attempting to access a function. This
              function was not supported and the pointer was NULL.

     Change : Updated driver to check function pointer validity before
              attempting to call any support functions.

  3. Updated copyright date.

Version 14.2.3 June 30, 2010
----------------------------
  Fixes:
  ======
   1. Problem: Invalid IP format accepted in HII NIC settings menu.(CQ#41701)

      Cause :  Validation logic did not check IP format validity.

      Change : Updated validation logic to detect offending invalid format.

   2. Problem: HII CHAP ID parameter accepts more than 32 characters.(CQ#41836)
    
      Cause :  Validation logic did not check iSCSI Configuration block version
               for length of CHAP ID boundary.

      Change : Updated driver to detect iSCSI Configuration block version, and
               enforce the appropriate length boundary.

   3. Problem: Duplicate offsets for some HII Data parameters. (CQ#45555)
   
      Cause :  Shared fields were used for certain parameters.

      Change : Created unique fields for each HII data parameter.

   4. Problem: Invalid CHAP ID characters saved. (CQ#46519)

      Cause :  The driver contains two unique CHAP ID fields to handle cases for
               iSCSI Boot configuration v1.0 and v2.0.  Only one of these fields
               is initialized and modified based on the version present in NVRAM,
               while the other is unused.  The unused field contains 
               uninitialized data when the HII configuration is saved.

      Change : Initialize unused CHAP ID field to NULL.

   5. Problem: After setting "Boot To Target" parameter to "One Time Disabled"
               in HII iSCSI Configuration menu, user cannot save parameter to 
               other values.

      Cause :  The "One Time Disabled" bit in iSCSI configuration was not 
               cleared when other values are saved by the user.

      Change : Clear "One Time Disabled" bit in iSCSI configuration, when other
               values are saved by the user.

   6. Problem: Unable to save subnet mask prefix for IPv6 in HII menu. (CQ#47723)
    
      Cause :  Driver incorrectly validated the parameter for use with IPv4.

      Change : Updated driver to validate the correct parameter field based
               on IP version flag.

   7. Problem: When running multiple devices, using different driver versions, 
               the HII browswer may crash when configuring Secondary Device MAC
               Address parameter on devices running v14.0.6 or older. (CQ#48114)

      Cause :  Differing internal structure lengths were causing a miscalculation
               for certain desired offsets.

      Change : Create a uniform structure length compatible with previous drivers
               to ensure the correct offsets are calculated and used.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1. Added "Hide Setup Prompt", "Banner Message Timeout", Boot Strap Type",

  Fixes:
  ======
  1. Problem: In HII MBA Configuration Menu, if VLAN Mode was disabled,
              VLAN ID entry was not displayed. (CQ#47915)

     Cause :  The logic skipped displaying VLAN ID entry when VLAN Mode
              was disabled.

     Change : Displayed VLAN ID entry even when VLAN Mode was disabled,
              but set it to READ ONLY.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1.  Updated driver for Firmware Management Protocol regarding iSCSI Boot
       update behavior.  If the current iSCSI Boot driver residing in NVRAM is
       IPv4 only, then the updated component will also be IPv4 only.  If the 
       current driver is IPv6 then updated component will be IPv6, and so on.
   
   2.  Added support for BCM57788 devices.

Version 12.2.1 May 21, 2009
---------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: Unable to save changes in HII. (CQ#40555).

   1. Updated sign-on string to display correct driver version.

Version 12.0.0 March 23, 2009
-----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: Network stack would display error messages after 
      ExitBootServices() is called.

      Cause : UNDI driver returns interface error when interface is 
      marked in *closed* state after ExitBootServices() is called.
     
      Change : Changed UNDI driver so that Rx Indication routine 
      returns NO_DATA when interface is in *closed* state instead
      of interface errors.

   2. Problem: "CHAP Secret" value should not be visible when screen loads.
               (CQ#39565)
   
      Change : Modified "CHAP Secret" parameter type from string to password.

   3. Problem: HII allowed out-of-range value for TCP port parameter in iSCSI
               Target menus. (CQ#39408)
   
      Change : Updated driver to enforce range checking for TCP port value.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Corrected punctuation in HII help menu strings.

   2. Updated applicable HII parameter default values to be consistent with

    1. Problem:
               NXI UEFI: No LEDs are lit after loading driver on BCM57790. (CQ#39245)

      Cause:
               Driver did not preserve the Miscellaneous Local Control register.

      Change:
               Driver performs read and modify when setting the Miscellaneous
               Local Control register.

      Impact:
               BCM57790 only.

    1. Problem:
               NXI UEFI: No LEDs are lit after loading driver on BCM57780. (CQ#39090)

      Cause:
               Driver did not preserve the Miscellaneous Local Control register.

      Change:
               Driver performs read and modify when setting the Miscellaneous
               Local Control register.

      Impact:
               BCM57780 only.

   ======
    1.Problem:
               UEFI undie: DRVDIAG failed in b57780. (CQ#38764)
      Cause:
               Driver Diag performed Memory Test with incorrect
               address range for BCM57760 and BCM57780.        

      Change:
               Driver Diag performs Memory Test with correct
               address range for BCM57760 and BCM57780.

      Impact:
               None.

Version 11.4.1 May 30, 2008
---------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
    1. Problem:
               DASH processor stalls when the driver applies a GRC reset
               while the DASH processor is also accessing the GRC reset register.

      Cause:
               A LSI bug is causing this behavior. This driver implements the
               LSI recommended workaround.        

      Change:
               The workaround requires the driver to acquire a mutex register
               before issuing the GRC reset.

      Impact:
               DASH firmware 0.96 or later is required for this fix to work.

Version 11.4.0 May 14, 2008
---------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Updated driver to correctly implement software handshake with DASH 
      firmware.
   2. Updated language code to RFC 3066 format.
 
   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Update CLP support to restore factory default MAC address.
   2. Display driver messages to StdErr.  If StdErr is not defined, then
      do not display any messages.

Version 11.0.8 March 12, 2008
----------------------------
   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Add CLP support to update permanent MAC Address. (CQ#31813)

Version 11.0.7 March 12, 2008
----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: BCM5784 fails DRVDIAG test. (CQ#34187)
   
      Cause : Incorrect memory offset was being applied.
 
      Change : Corrected memory offset.

Version 11.0.6 March 7, 2008
----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: BCM5787 fails DRVDIAG test. (CQ#34111)

      Cause : Incorrect register read/write mask was being applied at 
              offset 0x4000

      Change: Corrected register read/write mask

   2. Problem: PXE arp timeout and loss of mgmt fw connection when
      PXE/DASH enabled. (CQ#33998)
   
      Cause : Driver did not implement the new DASH firmware setup rules
              for the BCM5761/BCM5761E controllers.

      Change: Implemented required DASH firmware setup rules for the 
              BCM5761/BCM5761E controllers.

Version 11.0.5 February 11, 2008
-------------------------------
   Fixes:
   ======
   1. Problem: System might hang during driver bringup/shutdown if CLKREQ
      and ASPM L0s/L1 are enabled on PCI-E link control registers. (CQ#33808)
      
      Cause: Issuing a GRC reset with CLKREQ enabled is causing a global
      chip reset which causes PCI-E link to drop.

      Change: When ClkReq and L0s/L1 ASPM are enabled, driver will clear
      ClkReq enable bit before doing GRC reset and restore it after GRC reset.

Version 11.0.4 January 31, 2008
-------------------------------
   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Updated Copyright banner to reflect year of 2008.
   2. Implemented software workaround for AFE BW and Line Distortion problem
      with BCM5764/BCM5784/BCM5723 B0 devices.  Implementation based on the 
      content of the One-Time-Program (OTP) memory on the device.
   3. Removed support for BCM5784/BCM5764/5723 Ax devices.
   4. Updated APE inter-processor interface code to work with updated DASH
      firmware for BCM5761/BCM5761E device.

      controllers.

Version 11.0.1 October 23, 2007
-------------------------------
   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Improve Tx performance for 5784/5764 A0 devices.

Version 11.0.0 October 16, 2007
-------------------------------
   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Added support for 5784 and 5761/5761E controllers.

Version 10.7.0 May 8, 2007

   =============
   1. Rebuilt under UEFI EDK for EFI Specification v2.0.

Version 10.4.2 April 3, 2007
----------------------------
   Fixes:
   =====
   1.  Problem : Invoking UNDI_API PXE_OPCODE_GET_CONFIG_INFO can cause the
       system to crash.

       Change: Fixed the API routine to call correct PCI Config Read routines.

Version 10.4.1 February 16, 2007
-------------------------------

   =====
   1.  Problem : Application failed to update permanent MAC address or 
       firmware images (EFI driver or bootcode) on the LOM device which
       uses GPIO as write-protect control.

       Cause: Driver doesn't assert GPIO1 correctly when write-protect 
       is enabled.

       Change: Fixed NVRAM write enable routine to assert GPIO1 correctly.

Version 9.4.3 June 1, 2006
--------------------------
   Fixes:
   =====
   1.  Problem: BCM5704s cannot establish link with Marvell media conversion 
       module.

       Cause: Marvell serdes may take up 3 seconds or longer to start AUTONEG 
       process when PCS and SYNC are up. It doesn't start it until the copper
       interface side is up.  When Autoneg fails, it doesn't perform fallback
       mechanism correctly.  It later brings down the link again.  It causes 
       link up/down continuously.

      Change: Changed to BCM5704 AUTONEG logic to handle fallback mechanism 
      correctly.

Version 9.4.2 May 24, 2006
-------------------------
   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Enhanced Configuration Protocol to allow users to force fiber link speed 
      per customer's request.

      and restore permanent MAC address. (CQ24519)

Version 9.0.0 December 22, 2005
--------------------------------
   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request: Added support for BCM5752/BCM5755/BCM5787/BCM5714S/
      BCM5715S/BCM5780/BCM5780S/BCM5754 family devices.

Version 8.1.3 October 26, 2005
--------------------------------
   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Updated readme.txt to use native EFI driver instead of EBC driver
      in the example of ROM. (CQ#14469)

Version 8.1.2 September 22, 2005
--------------------------------
   Fixes:
   =====
   1.  Problem: EFI Update Protocol fails to update boot code on the device
       that has invalid checksum of manufacturing block.

       Cause: When driver is requested to update boot code, updating 
       protocol routine validates many other parameters 
       (magic number, checksum of manufacturing block, etc...) before
       programming of boot code is initiated.  Some of the OEM NICs with 
       Broadcom devices have been released with invalid manufacturing 
       checksum.  This causes updating boot code image to fail. 

      Change: Per customer's requests, changed EFI update image protocol 
      routine to not validate the checksum of manufacturing block.

Version 8.1.1 March 15, 2005
----------------------------
   Fixes:
   =====
   1. Problem: EFI driver doesn't work in some EFI environment 
      where virtual address is not the same as physical address.

      Cause : There is some limitation in mapping function interface 
      passed by SNP module where it only allows 100 mapping.  Older
      driver cannot call this interface to map every preallocated 
      Rx buffers, etc...  

      Change: Changed UNDI driver to call mapping function provided
      by SNP module one time during initialization.  Driver then 
      manages the buffer pool.

      Impact:
               None.

Version 8.1.0 January 31, 2005
------------------------------
   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Enhance EFI Image Update Protocol to have the capability to 
      upgrade the boot code firmware. (CQ#11673)

      Change: Change Image Update Protocol handler to look at content
      of the image being passed to see if it's an Expansion ROM image (
      0x55 0xaa ...) or boot code (0x66 0x99 0x55 0xaa....) and also  
      add logic to program boot code image.

Version 7.7.4 December 8, 2004
------------------------------
   Fixes:
   =====
   1. Problem: Updating EFI driver via EFI Update Image protocol is 
      slow.

      Change: Changed to set NVRAM control bits correctly in NVRAM 
      write routine.

      Impact:
               None.

Version 7.7.3 December 7, 2004
------------------------------
   Fixes:
   =====
   1. Problem: EFI Drvcfg doesn't configure speed correctly. (CQ#11534)

      Cause  : Parameters are not stored correctly.

      Change: Fixed the configuration routine to store parameters
      correctly.

      Impact:
               None.

Version 7.7.2 December 6, 2004
------------------------------
   Fixes:
   =====
   1. Problem: Diagnostics fails on BCM5701 LOM devices. (CQ#11362)

      Cause  : RequestedMediaType field of the device structure was not set to 
      MAC or PHY loopback during MAC or PHY loopback.  If a link change occurs,
      PHY initialization routine can change the loopback setting.

      Change: Change diagnostics code to set RequestedMediaType field with
      correct values during loopback testing.      

      Impact:
               None.

Version 7.7.1 December 2, 2004
------------------------------
   Fixes:
   =====
   1. Problem: Diagnostics fails on the Shasta family devices.

      Cause  : Incorrect memory and register information is used.

      Change: Change diagnostics code to use correct memory and register
      information for Shasta family devices.

      Impact:
               None.


Version 7.7.0 November 16, 2004
------------------------------

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request: Preserve content of lower 14-bit of Serdes control 
      register which includes parameters of Predriver current, 
      Tx driver current, and pre-emphasis coefficient.
      
      Change : Changed PXE firmware to preserve content of lower 14-bit 
      of Serdes control when TX Serdes overwrite feature is enabled.

   2. Request: Added ST M45PExxx/Saifun SA25Fxxx/AT25F512N support for 
      Shasta family devices.

        The following is the supported NVRAM summary:

                                8/4/2/1MB Flash
      Change : Modified Flash driver to support above devices.  

   3. Request : Added support for BCM5751 devices in 12x12 packages.

      Change : Changed PXE code to recognize devices with PCI vendor ID/device
      ID of 0x14e4/0x16f7,0x14e4/0x16fd,0x14e4/0x16fe, and 0x14e4/0x16dd.

Version 7.5.1 October 19, 2004
------------------------------

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request:  Enhance Driver Unload feature so that issuing explicit 
      disconnect command is not necessary when "unload" command is
      used to unload a driver.

      Change: EFI Image Unload command is supposed to disconnect all 
      components that are attaching to the image being unloaded.  
      However, this command might not disconnect all components due 
      to a bug in SNP in some core firmware environments. 
      Changed driver unloading routine to disconnect all components 
      that are attaching to the image handle of the UNDI driver.

      Impact:
             None.
   
Version 7.5.0 October 18, 2004
-----------------------------

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request:  Add support for BCM575x-based NICs/LOMs.

      Change: Changed PXE code to recognize and support BCM575x-based 
             NICs/LOMS.

      Impact:
             None.
   
   2. Request: Make enhancement so that EFI driver and ASF/IPMI can run 
      concurrently.

      Change: Changed EFI UNDI code to handshake with ASF/IPMI firmware
      during initialization/shutdown sequence.

Version 7.0.4 October 7, 2004
-----------------------------

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request:  Add EFI Driver Image Update Protocol.  This allows user 
      application to interface with the driver for programming the EFI ROM 
      on the NIC's NVRAM. (CQ#10977)

      The GUID and protocol interface are shown as follows:
        {0xC07B8D1F,0xF359,0x4C84,0xBF,0xCA,0xB1,0xE5,0x36,0xE0,0x14,0x26} 

        (EFIAPI *EFI_FC_DRIVER_IMAGE_UPDATE_PROTOCOL_UPDATE_DRIVER) (
               IN       EFI_HANDLE              ControllerHandle,
               IN       UINT8                   *FwImagePtr,
               IN       UINT32                  FwImageSize
        );


      Change: Implemented logic to program EFI image on the NIC's NVRAM,
      program Expansion ROM size parameters based on the size of the driver
      image, and finally administratively enable PXE parameter.

      Impact:
               None.

Version 7.0.3 May 26, 2004
----------------------------

   Fixes:
   =====
   1. Problem: System might crash during ExitBootService if driver is stopped 
      and started again (e.g reconnect -r) before ExitBootService is called.

      Cause  : UNDI driver maintains a list of devices that it controls.  There
      is a bug in DriverStop where it doesn't remove the control block from 
      this list of devices even the memory block of that control block is freed.  
      During ExitBootService, driver refers to memory block that has been 
      freed which causes system to crash.

      Change: Fixed the DriverStop routine so that it removes the control block
      from the list of managed devices.

      Impact:
               None.

Version 7.0.2 March 30, 2004
----------------------------

   Fixes:
   =====
   1. Problem: BCM5701-based NIC/LOM PXE might use zero MAC address 
               when it's used with older version of boot code.

      Cause  : UNDI driver assumes that MAC address are programmed by the 
               bootcode.  However, older version of boot code doesn't 
               program MAC address correctly in a certain scenario. UNDI 
               driver v6.8.0 should have fixed this problem. However, 
               serial EEPROM driver has a bug which causes MAC address in 
               the serial EEPROM cannot be read correctly.

      Change: Fixed serial EEPROM driver so that MAC address can be read
              correctly.

      Impact:
               None.

Version 7.0.1 March 11, 2004
----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ========
   1. Problem: EFI core firmware doesn't shutdown EFI driver before it 
      transfers control to the O/S.  Linux driver doesn't bring up the
      chip properly if it's not in unintialized state.

      Change: Added an ExitBootServices event hook so that it issues GRC
      reset to the devices that it's managing.

      Impact: None.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request:
             Increase support for maximum up to 64 NICs or LOMs.

      Impact:
             None.

Version 7.0.0 August 18, 2003
-----------------------------
   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request:
             Improve bit error performance of 5703AX and 5704AX when used
             with long cable lengths.
      Change:
             Program the phy's ADC and Gamma registers to more optimum 
             settings.
      Impact:
             None.

   2. Request:
             Improve Serdes drive levels on 5704s.
      Change:
             Programed the serdes config registers so that SerDes' drive 
             transmission level is 1.2V.

      Impact:
             None. 

Version 6.8.1 July 29, 2003
----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ========
   1. Problem: UNDI driver might indicate a few packets with invalid length
               to upper layer right after second and subsequent driver 
               init/shutdown.
  
      Cause  : After second init, driver indices are not reinitialized.  

      Change: UNDI driver is changed to reinitialize indices.

      Impact:
               None.

Version 6.8.0 July 21, 2003
----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ========
   1. Problem: UNDI driver might use zero MAC address when it's used with 
               older version of boot code.  This will cause UNDI driver to
               fail in network boot.  This should only happen on a certain 
               LOM  applications where WoL is disabled.
  
      Cause  : UNDI driver assumes that MAC address are programmed by the 
               bootcode. However, older version of boot code doesn't program 
               MAC address correctly in a certain scenario.

      Change: If MAC registers contain zero MAC address, UNDI driver will 
              retrieve MAC address from the NVRAM directly.

      Impact:
               None.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request:
               Enable hardware fixes in 5704_Bx parts for known 5704 Ax errata.
      Change:
               Added code to driver init routines to enable hardware fixes in
               5704 B0 silicon.  See 5704 errata for more details info about
               the changes/fixes in B0 silicon.

      Impact:
               None.

Version 6.1.2 May 12, 2003
----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ========
   1. Problem: Driver doesn't pass traffic if the fiber interface is 
               connected to a port that has AUTONEG turned off. (CQ#7781)

      Cause: Fallback mechanism doesn't work when autonegotiation fails 
             and interface doesn't receive configuration change from 
             the link partner.

      Change: Fixed the PHY setup routine so that fallback mechanism 
              works correctly.

      Impact: None.

Version 6.1.1 May 08, 2003
----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ========
   1. Problem: DHCP process intermittently doesn't completely successfully. 

      Cause: This issue is caused by the following reasons:
               * Status block is not updated in a certain race condition. 
               * Link might be completely before base code starts sending 
                 out DHCP request packets.  This causes packets not being
                 sent to DHCP server.

      Change: Changed the UNDI_Initialize API call so that it checks for 
              link up before returning back to the callers when Cable Check 
              is requested.  
              Changed so that UNDI doesn't dynamically turn on and off
              host coalescing block. 

      Impact: None.

   2. Problem: Multicast packets are not filtered correctly.  If 
               RECEIVE_FILTER UNDI API is called with
               PXE_RECEIVE_FILTER_DISABLE is called, the controller
               is mistakenly programmed to operate in promiscuous 
               mode.
 
      Cause  : If RECEIVE_FILTER API is called with PXE_RECEIVE_DISABLE, 
               the driver will receive unwanted packets from the network.  
               This can cause lower performance and packet drops.

      Change:  Changed so that correct filtering is disabled when this 
               API is called.

      Impact:
               None.


   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request: Provide proper indication of media presence after UNDI 
               INIITIALIZE calls.  This allows base code to abort PXE
               boot if no cable is attached.

      Change:  Changed the UNDI Initialize API so that it polls for
               link status.

      Impact:
               None.

   2. Request: "Revision Level of Code/Data" in PCI ROM header should 
               contain version of EFI UNDI driver.

      Change:  Enhanced EFIROM.EXE utility to initialize the mentioned
               field with correct UNDI version number.

      Impact:
               None.


Version 6.1.0 May 04, 2003
----------------------------
   Fixes:
   ========
   1. Problem: In some extremely rare situations, 5702/03/04 Copper NICs
               may not link up after a PHY reset.

      Cause: On some 5702/03/04 PHY cores, there is a small probability of
             lock up after a PHY reset.

      Change: Added code to detect PHY lock up after a PHY reset and
              reset again if lock up is detected.

      Impact: The added lock up detection and recovery code affects
              driver reset and link down events where PHY resets are
              performed.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   2. Request: Enhanced to allow users to start diagnostics without specifying
               the child handle.

      Change:  Changed diagnostics upper layer interface to retrieve child handle
               from internal data structure with given controller handler.

      Impact:
               None.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   3. Request: Enhanced to take advantage DUAL ADDRESS that is supported in 
               EFI 1.10.14.61.

      Change:  Changed initializing code to enable DUAL_ADDRESS feature for
               PCI/IO of devices.

      Impact:
               None.


v6.0.2 (03/05/03) - Fixed a problem where register test fails on BCM5705 when
                    no cable is connected. (CQ7153)
                  - Added an interface to export UNDI driver version to 
                    external management software entity. 
                  - Enhanced EFIROM application so that it extracts UNDI driver
                    version from EFI UNDI driver and to put UNDI version 
                    information into EFI ROM header.

v6.0.1 (02/27/03) - Added MAC and PHY loopback feature in addition to 
                    current memory and register test.  Driver transmits 
                    2000 packets with incremental length (from 64 bytes to 
                    1518 bytes) and verifies it can receive all packets 
                    back correctly. (CQ6692)
                 -  Fixed a typo in product description string. (CQ 7085)

v6.0.0 (02/13/03) - Added support for newer version of BCM5705 family.
                  - Enhanced so that packet is always padded with 0's if 
                    the packet length is less than minimum ethernet packet
                    size.  The padding is now padded by hardware ASICs 
                    instead of software.

v5.0.5 (12/17/02) - Added EBC (EFI Byte Code) support.  See section

v5.0.4 (12/11/02) - Added support for new PCI devices (0x14e4/0x16c7,0x14e4/0x16c6,
                    0x14e4/0x1696).

v5.0.3 (11/26/02) - Enhanced so that version in drivers command now contains
                    UNDI driver version.
                  - Fixed a problem where link monitoring timer is not stopped
                    when driver is shut down.

v5.0.2 (10/03/02) - Second channel of BCM5704 fiber NIC is not detected  
                    in core firmware v1.02. (CQ5627)

v5.0.1 (09/17/02) - Fixed a problem where FTP file download hangs when B5700B2 
                    is used. (CQ5501)
                  - Added BCM5704 Fiber support.
