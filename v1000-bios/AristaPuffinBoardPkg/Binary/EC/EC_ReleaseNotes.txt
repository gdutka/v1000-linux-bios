      How to check the PD FW version of your board ?
          1. Boot to BIOS setup menu. 
          2. [Setup Utility] -> the [Main] label -> [Firmware Version] -> 
               * USB PD Section1 Version: 010B
               * USB PD Section2 Version: 010B
             where 'B' is the hexadecimal minor version, i.e. v11

      How to update the PD FW ?
          Please refer to instructions in below link.
