Rel_2.05
September 17, 2021

1. Get BoardRevision from GPIO5, GPIO6, GPIO7 and GPIO40, and save it in PcdBoardRevision.
   File changed: PlatformCustomizePei.c.
2. MAC Address is read from SPI offset 0 to 5 for Ethernet port 0 and SPI offset 6 to 11 for Ethernet Port 1.
   MAC address is displayed in the Efidebug version of the BIOS.
   File changed: AmdCpmOemInitPeim.c.
3. When eMMC is enabled, GPIO86 was getting changed. Commented out that line of code for changing GPIO86
   in the file AmdCpmOemTable.c. GPIO86 is used as GPIO Input for FPGA_CRC_ERR in Valhalla.

Rel_2.04
August 10, 2021

1. Moved AmdCpmOemTable.c file to AristaVlhBoardPkg\Override\AmdCpmPkg\Addendum\Oem\Bilby\Pei\AmdCpmOemInitPei\ folder
   to isolate all the changes for different versions of the board.
2. Changed setup variable "AMD CBS\FCH Common Options\System Control\Toggle All PwrGood On CF9‚Äù from <Auto> to <Enabled>. 
   With this change, the Valhalla board with Management Phy Rework can boot successfully with normal BIOS without
   efi debug messages enabled.
3. Changed setup variable "AMD CBS\NBIO Common Options\NB Configuration\IOMMU" to <Enabled>.
4. Changed setup variable "AMD CBS\NBIO Common Options\Audio IOs" to <DISABLE AUDIO IOs>.
5. Changed setup variable "AMD PBS\BLINK LED" to <GPIO 11 Output Low>.
6. Implemented fix for allocating prefetch memory to PCIe root hub. Modified PciHotPlugDxe.c file.
   Reserved 0x2000 for I/O range and 0x6400000 for NonPrefetchableMmio to PCI root bridge, Dev. 01, Fun. 01.
7. Use EGPIO26 and EGPIO27 for PCI reset instead of GPIO6.
8. Disabled sending Post Codes to the screen by setting PcdH2OPostCodeScreenSupported to FALSE.
__________________________________________________________________________________________
Rel_2.03
July 16, 2021

1. Moved FPGA base address to 0xFEED_0000, length 0x1_0000. This does not conflict with the MMIO range used by PCIe.
2. Reserved memory for FPGA from 0xFEED_0000 to 0xFEED_FFFF in the ACPI code, file Mother.asl
__________________________________________________________________________________________
Rel. 2.02
June 30, 2021

1. Modified GPIO table to match GPIO document on the shared google drive.
2. Assigned NMI to AGPIO4.
3. Assigned GEVENT/INT to AGPIO3, AGPIO86 and AGPIO24.
4. Reserved memory for FPGA from 0xD000_0000 to 0xD000_FFFF in the ACPI code.

_________________________________________________________________________________________
Rel. 2.01
June 25, 2021

1. Disabled TPM Pcds and initialized TPM before booting in SSLpcLate.c file.
2. Changed BIOS Setup AMD CBS\NBIO Common Options\GFX Configuration\Integrated Graphics Controller to <Disabled>.
3. Changed BIOS Setup AMD PBS\Primary Video Adapter to <Ext Graphics (PEG)>.

   With these changes, now there is only one reset during BIOS boot and the boot time to
   EFI Shell is reduced to 25 second from power-up.
_________________________________________________________________________________________

Rel. 2.00
June 11, 2021

1. Ported to Bilby BIOS Tag 05.32.50.0012 with AMD EmbeddedPI-FP5_1.2.0.6.
2. Added BIOSImageDirectory16M.xml in the PlatformConfig folder that allows building a 16MB flash image
   after setting "Raven_16M = YES" in Project.env file.
3. Set "gEfiAmdAgesaModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdResetMode|0x04" for SPIReadMode using Dual IO (1-2-2).
   This should match RomSigData at offset 0x43 in the file GenOemRomSig.c.
   (Release 1.10 had this set to 0x02 for SPIReadMode using Dial IO (1-1-2), but RomSigData offset 0x43 was
   set to 0x04, which may have resulted in power cycle test failure.)

Rel. 1.10
May 28, 2021

1. Revert back SPI clock change made in  PicassoChipsetPkg\Tools\GenOemRomSig\GenOemRomSig.c file.
2. Added Ethernet changes received from Ravi to AmdOemCpmTable.c file modifying UpdateXgbeFchPcds()
   and ConfigureEthernetDxioPorts().
3. Changed SPI speed to 33.33 MHZ for (Normal Speed) and (Fast Speed New), in the file PlatformStage1Init.c,
   verified by reading SPI100 Speed Config register at MMIO address 0xFEC10022. This is set to 0x1131.
4. Modified the build procedure to leave 7.875MB of SPI blank for OS load.
   The SPI has 32 bytes of the Embedded Firmware Structure at offset 0x20000.
_________________________________________________________________________________________



Rel. 1.09

1. Removed changes made in Rel. 1.08 (eSPI single IO mode and SPI Dual IO 1-1-2 mode).
2. Changed SPI clock to 33.3MHz.
3. Added GPIO settings received from Ravi.
_________________________________________________________________________________________



Rel. 1.08
May 21, 2021

1. Changed eSPI mode to single IO mode just as in BoardBringup rel. 10 BIOS
2. Change SPI access mode to Dual IO (1-1-2) from Dual IO (1-2-2).
_________________________________________________________________________________________

Rel. 1.07
May 19, 2021

1. Added TPM ASL code in the (Project Folder)\AcpiTables rather than in the OemAcpiTables folder.
   This fixes the issue of TPM not being detected by the OS.
2. Fixed setting setup default values when CMOS is not valid. This fixes the issue of 
   setup changes being loaded with default values after power cycling.
   Now any variables changed in the BIOS setup are maintained after power cycling.
   This also fixes the issue of BIOS setup showing LPC_TPM rather than SPI_TPM after power cycling.
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Rel. 1.06
May 12, 2021

1. Fixed the issue that the variable was to LPC_TPM when initializing the TPM.
   Always forced to set the variable to SPI_TPM.
2. Disabled the routine EndOfDxeLockSpi as requested by Ravi.
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Rel. 1.05
May 11, 2021

1. Added Post Code display on the serial port.
2. Used gCpmDxioTopologyTable_RV2 table for PCIe DXI mapping. (Used AmdCpmOemTable.c file from Ravi)
   This has fix for the hot-plug issue.
3. Enabled TPM_CS_L on AGPIO29 pin to select correct IOMUX offset.
   (The file PicassoChipsetPkg\ChipsetSvcPei\PlatformStage1Init.c was using offset 0x1c instead of 0x1D
   to select IOMUX for TPM_CS_L. Corrected this.)
4. TPM is now enabled just before booting.
5. Added change to enable eMMC at HS400 speed.

_________________________________________________________________________________________   


Rel. 1.04T2

        Arista Board Bringup Release Notes

Rel_01: SPD for SODIMM, with and without ECC
Rel_02: SPD Bytes 60-77 modified as for a customer with memory down
Rel_03: Try building for 16MB SPI, set Raven_16M to YES in Project.env
Rel_04: Used sample xml file for 16MB SPI and modified it for Arista
Rel_05: Used original SPD data for Samsung UDIMM, except changed byte 3 to 0x03 for SODIMM.
        Build it with Raven_16M = NO, created 8MB BIOS and WNC populated 8MB SPI part, same as on Bilby,
        This BIOS boot on Bilby board with one UDIMM module.
Rel_06: Same as Rel_05, except disabled TPM in the Project.dsc file.
Rel_07: Put memory configuration data in CMOS instead of SPI, suspect BIOS is not able to write to SPI.
        Set PcdAmdPspApcbRecoveryEnable to FALSE to prevent BIOS in going to recovery mode, trying to isolat
		problem.
Rel_08: Same as Rel_07 with additional debug messages when BIOS is writing to SPI to verify if write to SPI
        is successful.
Rel_09: Changed file SSEspiLib.c file to set Espi.IoMode to 0 for single mode operation of SPI.
Note: After a call with WNC-Arista-Insyde, discovered that SPI WP# signal should be connected to CPU.
      WNC reworked a board and connected the SPI WP# pint to CPU, after the rework, BIOS booted to EFI Shell.
	  
Rel_10: Got instruction from AMD on how to change SPI mode in the Agesa code to single mode ot dual mode instead of
        quad mode, implemented the change and released both 8MB and 16MB BIOS images. Both images are able
		to boot to EFI shell without any modifications to the hardware.
